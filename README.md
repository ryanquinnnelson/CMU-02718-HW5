# CMU-02718-HW5
Fall 2020 Regression Model Project for Computational Medicine

The goal of this project is to design a subunit vaccine targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, this project focuses on selecting a set of peptides which could theoretically be delivered using an RNA vaccine.


### Project Structure
Vaccine design functions and helper functions are implemented as package `vaccine` under /packages.
